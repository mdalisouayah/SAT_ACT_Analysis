# The SAT vs. ACT battle for leadership

### Executive Summary


This project is about the performance of the two major college entry standard tests in the US: the SAT and the ACT.
The SAT is the older test and as such was leading the college standardized test scene for a long time. The ACT which was launched in the 50's won ground and has become the leader in the industry.

This project will analyze, among other things, the participation rates of both tests within the 50 states of the US. It will shed light on   trends based on the analysis of the 2017 and 2018 numbers for both tests.

In order to reach the analysis stage, a number of steps were taken to clean the data from any errors or data type incompatibility. the different sources of data were then combined for ease of reference and comparability.

At the Exploratory Data analysis phase, a high level statistical analysis was used to detect any inconsistency in the data. a couple of figures in the Maryland figures were detected during this phase, and corrected using public data information pertaining to the correct figures.

A number of figures are provided in this report to help better visualize the evolution or the interaction between some of the variables under analysis. Some of these visuals have been used to supplement the presentation deck attached to this report.

Two caveats to the analysis are: **(1)** the tests are not similar, in terms of components and grading scale. Efforts have been deployed to normalize the data, to the extent possible. **(2)** The data from 2018 is not as detailed as that of 2017, which limited a detailed comparabiity over the years.
